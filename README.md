a simple .bat script to automatically pull all actively folowed git repos

# how to use 
to use this script you can just simply download the [release](https://github.com/C2gl/autopullscripter/releases) script from github. 
you place said script in a folder. and **in that same folder** you are to manually add a .txt file called repos.txt

in that repos.txt file you can add the paths to the repositories you wish to track, 

these should be added as plain text, and each on a different line, no added text. 
you can check the [example file](https://github.com/C2gl/autopullscripter/blob/main/repos.txt) in the github repository


# future features 
in the (far) future, quite a few features are planned, not to be a usefull repository, but as a fun project to get my hands on some basic coding

- [ ] the ability to pull new repos
- [ ] an automated fetcher to see release changes when you didn't keep yourself up to date with the repo for a while
- [ ] use the script to download new repos automatically 
- [ ] sort repositories by category and choose what category to pull
- [ ] the ability to have a cron job

# report issues 
if you see issues, or want to help developing this, feel free to.
i would be asking to explain why and how since this is mostly a learning project. so i am not looking for stuff to be done in place of me 

# important! 
this repo is both on github and gitlab, 
whilst bug reports on gitlab will be looked at, the main used place will be github. and thus that one will be more actively used, especially for code and pull requests
