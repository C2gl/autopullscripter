a simple bat script to automatically pull all actively folowed git repos

# how to use 
to use this, you can eddit in the auto_git_pull.bat the paths to github repositoried you wish to track


# future features 
in the (far) future, quite a few features are planned, not to be a usefull repository, but as a fun project to get my hands on some basic coding

- the ability to pull new repos
- an automated fetcher to see release changes when you didn't keep yourself up to date with the repo for a while
