a simple bat script to automatically pull all actively folowed git repos

# how to use 
to use this, you can eddit in the [auto_git_pull.bat](https://github.com/C2gl/autopullscripter/blob/main/auto_git_pull.bat) the paths to github repositoried you wish to track

you can see a few existing demo repos to see how this is to be done, a current update is on the way where they way this has to be done should be changed


# future features 
in the (far) future, quite a few features are planned, not to be a usefull repository, but as a fun project to get my hands on some basic coding

- the ability to pull new repos
- an automated fetcher to see release changes when you didn't keep yourself up to date with the repo for a while
- use the script to download new repos automatically 
- sort repositories by category and choose what category to pull
- the ability to have a cron job

# report issues 
if you see issues, or want to help developing this, feel free to.
i would be asking to explain why and how since this is mostly a learning project. so i am not looking for stuff to be done in place of me
